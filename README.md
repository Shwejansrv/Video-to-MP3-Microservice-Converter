Key Insights<br/>
🔄 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication: Understanding the difference allows developers to choose the right approach based on application needs, optimizing responsiveness and resource utilization.<br/>
🗂️ Strong vs. Eventual Consistency: Developers must decide between immediate data consistency or eventual synchronization, impacting performance and scalability based on application requirements.<br/>
🧩 Microservices Integration: Combining different technologies creates robust applications, demonstrating the power of microservices in real-world scenarios like video conversion.<br/>
📦 Containerization with Docker: Docker streamlines the development process, ensuring consistent environments across different stages of deployment in Kubernetes.<br/>
🔑 Security with JWTs: Utilizing JWTs for user authentication enhances application security by ensuring only authorized users can access services.<br/>
📬 Message Queuing with RabbitMQ: Reliable message passing is crucial for microservices, enabling asynchronous processing and improving application responsiveness.<br/>
🛠️ StatefulSets for Persistence: Using StatefulSets in Kubernetes ensures that critical data and message integrity are maintained, even in the event of pod failures.<br/>
